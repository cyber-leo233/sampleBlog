          My name is John and living the simple life saved my life
        </h2>
        <p class="article-body">
          <strong>I used to be a pack rat.</strong>  I had so many things that I thought that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was too much.

          Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship.

          How I turned things around
        </h2>
        <p class="article-body">
          <strong>I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything.</strong>  I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job.
          It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, I didn't know what else to do. And it worked.

          Now I live the simple life
        </h2>
        <p class="article-body">
          Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time to enjoy.</p>
        <p class="article-body">
          With how much it turned my life around, <strong> I felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I did it, and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I started this site!</strong>
